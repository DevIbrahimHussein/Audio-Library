index db
_____________

Index ALL foreign key columns.
Create more indexes ONLY if:
Queries are slow.
You know the data volume is going to increase significantly.
Run statistics when populating a lot of data in tables.

If a query is slow, look at the execution plan and:
If the query for a table only uses a few columns, put all those columns into an index
Don't waste resources indexing tiny tables (hundreds of records).
Index multiple columns in order from high cardinality to less. This means: first index the columns with more distinct values, followed by columns with fewer distinct values.
If a query needs to access more than 10% of the data, a full scan is normally better than an index.
